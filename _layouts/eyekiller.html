                <h3>Rumble Labs</h3>
                <p>In one of my favourite projects to-date, I had a primary role in the design and development of the Rumble Labs portfolio site. With the aim to showcase our work and content in a highly engaging way, I conducted all of the photography for the website and created very visual designs, which I later helped build using HAML, Sass and Javascript on the framework <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>.</p>

                <h3>Belfast Ruby</h3>
                <p>Taking a completely different approach from the Rumble Labs portfolio, I designed this site for local Ruby developer meetups with the focus on typography and simplicity. I built this site on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> because of its ability to keep the code clean and efficient, with the use of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and templating language <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/">Liquid</a>.</p>

                <h3>The Laboratory</h3>
                <p>The Laboratory website was a fast-moving project that I designed and built within a few days, as we wanted to move quickly to advertise our new co-working space in Belfast. I enjoyed the chance to experiment with a playful design, structure and colour scheme.</p>

                <h3>Reverspective</h3>
                <p>I recently designed a website for a London-based artist whose work is quirky, colourful and often panoramic. To showcase the work in the best light, I made use of the full-width of the screen, and kept the design clean and minimal, while still retaining personality. </p>
